    - Read heavy

2. Is it a distributed system or a single server?
    - Distributed System

3. Which is more important: Consistency or Availability?
    - Availability

4. How many tweets are expected daily?
    - 100 million tweets
      
5. Are there events that lead to a spike in activity?
    - Yes, breaking news and emergencies, live events and sporting matches, etc, can lead to a spike in events.

6. What is the read-to-write ratio?
    - 100:1
    
7. What is the average size of each tweet size?
    - 200 bytes

8. How many Daily Active Users does the system have?
    - 200 million users
  
9. How many favorites does the system have per day?
    - 1 billion favorites

10. How many total views does the system generate per day?
    - 28 billion views

11. How many tweets are expected to have media files attached and uploaded per day?
    - 20 million

12. What is the average size of media files?

### Functional Requirements

|      | 
| ----------- | 
| 1. Users can post new tweets.      | 
| 2. Users can follow other users.   | 
| 3. Users can favorite tweets.   | 
| 4. Timeline is generated by the system, consisting of the top tweets of the people followed by the user. |

### Non-Functional Requirements

|      | 
| ----------- | 
| 1. High Reliability  | 
| 2. High Availability   | 
| 3. Low latency: acceptable latency for Timeline generation is 200ms | 
| 4. Scalable |

## Capacity Estimation

### 1. Traffic Estimates

Daily we have 100 million tweets and 28 billion tweet views

Read and write per second:

 - 100 million tweets / (24 * 3600) = 1150 tweets/s

 - 28 billion tweet views / (24 * 3600) = 324000 tweet views/s

### 2. Storage Estimates

Total storage required for 1 month:

 - (100 million * 200 bytes)  + (20 million * 200 kb) * 30 = (20 GB + 4TB) * 30 = 120TB

Total storage required for 1 year:

 - 120TB * (1 year * 12 months) = 1.4 PB

Total storage required for 10 years:

 - 1.4PB * 10 years = 14 PB
